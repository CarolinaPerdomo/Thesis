### Thesis

Here you can find the Notebooks developed in Mathematica for my Ph.D. thesis and other resources. We use the FeynArts and FeynCalc packages to generate the diagrams and amplitudes.

# For the electron correction in 2-loop QED, the divergent part of the amplitude is evaluated using the regularization process known as Implicit Regularization (IREG). For more reference on how to apply this method, you can check our articles [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-021-09259-6) and, [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/13/6/956).

# The divergent integrals were calculated following the rules of IREG. The final 1-loop and 2-loop results for this divergent integrals with IREG can be found here.

# For the 1-loop electron correction using IREG, we also calculate the integrals with finite results. For this, we use Package-X. Those notebooks and notes can be found in this repository as well.
